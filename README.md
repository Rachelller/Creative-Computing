# THINKING OF CREATIVE COMPUTING

### CREATIVE COMPUTING FOR ME
Creative computing, electronics and coding are brand new skills for me. Before taking this course, I usually used ready-made applications and web pages as a user, and it is difficult for me to imagine how to use letters, numbers and characters to create a concrete electronic world. But looking back, many of my previous projects were related to programs, web pages, and the development of electronic technology in the future. It is undeniable that I prefer traditional art forms, but as a student of Graphic communication design, I will be more or less affected by the current Affected by the mainstream trend, whether to follow the trend or stick to oneself is also a question worth pondering for me.

### CREATIVE COMPUTING FOR ART AND DESIGN
Today's art can be divided into two main forms-electronic and traditional manual methods (like painting, manual printing and engraving). It can be clearly seen that the current design and art market is rapidly being occupied by electronic forms, but it is undeniable that many artists still tend to use manual art forms.

## REFLECTION
This week I learned some Markdown Syntax, tried to edit the Read Me File on Github, and got a preliminary understanding of Creative computing. I think I started to become interested in creative computing and I also broadened my understanding of GCD. Before I always used ready-made software to design web pages, but now I realised that web pages are composed of codes.

Observing the current design and art trends, I think electronic technology will continue to develop in the future. Although I don't think it will replace the traditional art market, it is undeniable that it will become the mainstream trend (or has become) in the design and art market. The most intuitive difference between electronic art and traditional art is its movement. This artistic expression method is interactive and attracts the audience's attention.


## MY IDEA
+ Began to Study coding and design a website
+ I am thinking that human bodies or stories will always disappear with death, but the Internet can be said to be an eternal existence. So I want to use the Internet to leave traces of people's existence, such as reshaping the human body in the form of models, turning characters into visual codes like emoji, and so on. By recording people in the form of codes to create eternal existence, and storing these data together on a web page, this sounds like a human body database.


## FOR NEW LEARNERS
Keep going and stay curious, we always have a lot to learn. As a beginner, creative Computing is a difficult course, but it is also very interesting, just like talking to a computer and giving it instructions. Besides, don't have too much pressure and this is not a day or two to learn well. Keep a good learning attitude and try your best:3
